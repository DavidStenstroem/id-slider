Id Slider
=============

# How-To

  1. Download the folder. The following files are not necessary and can be excluded:
    * .gitignore
    * bs-config.json
    * gulpfile.js
    * package-lock.json
    * package.json
    * README.md
  2. Insert the images for the show into the `slider-images` folder.
  3. Update the included `slider.json`. The title property is the title to be displayed on the site. The `images` array has to include all the names of the files in the `slider-images` folder and the corresponding text for the image. If the image is not present in the `slider.json` file, the image will not be displayed on the site.
  4. Done!
